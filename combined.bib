  abstract =     { We review 74 experiments with no, low, or high
                  performance-based financial incentives. The modal
                  result is no effect on mean performance (though
                  variance is usually reduced by higher
                  payment). Higher incentive does improve performance
                  often, typically judgment tasks that are responsive
                  so better effort. Incentives also reduce
                  \&quot;presentation\&quot; effects (e.g., generosity
                  and risk-seeking). Incentive effects are comparable
                  to effects of other variables, particularly
                  \&quot;cognitive capital\&quot; and task
                  \&quot;production\&quot; demands, and interact with
                  those variables, so a narrow-minded focus on
                  incentives alone is misguided. We also note that no
                  replicated study has made rationality violations
                  disappear purely by raising incentives. Copyright

                  unavailable. A new data set for the Safelite Glass

                  productivity will rise, the firm will attract a more
                  able workforce, and variance in output across
                  individuals at the firm will rise when it shifts to
                  piece rates. In Safelite, productivity effects
                  amount to a 44-percent increase in output per
                  worker. This firm apparently had selected a
                  suboptimal compensation system, as profits also

                  Kepler Quarter 2 public release data by volunteers
                  engaged in the Planet Hunters citizen science
                  project. The two candidates presented here survive
                  checks for false positives, including examination of
                  the pixel offset to constrain the possibility of a
                  background eclipsing binary. The orbital periods of
                  the planet candidates are 97.46 days (KIC 4552729)
                  and 284.03 (KIC 10005758) days and the modeled
                  planet radii are 5.3 and 3.8 R ⊕ . The latter star
                  has an additional known planet candidate with a
                  radius of 5.05 R ⊕ and a period of 134.49 days,
                  which was detected by the Kepler pipeline. The
                  discovery of these candidates illustrates the value
                  of massively distributed volunteer review of the
                  Kepler database to recover candidates which were

  abstract =     {A parametric distribution on permutations of k
                  objects is derived from gamma random variables. The
                  probability of a permutation is set equal to the
                  probability that k independent gamma random
                  variables with common shape parameter and different
                  scale parameters are ranked according to that
                  permutation. This distribution is motivated by
                  considering a competition in which k players,
                  scoring points according to independent Poisson
                  processes, are ranked according to the time until r
                  points are scored. The distributions obtained in
                  this way include the popular Luce-Plackett and
                  Thurstone-Mosteller-Daniels ranking models. These
                  gamma-based distributions can serve as alternatives
                  to the null ranking model in which all permutations
                  are equally likely. Here, the gamma models are used
                  to estimate the probability distribution of the
                  order of finish in a horse race when only the
                  probability of finishing first is given for each
                  horse. Gamma models with shape parameters larger
                  than 1 are found to be superior to the most commonly
                  applied model (shape parameter 1). Examples are
                  limited to small values of k because of the
                  complicated calculations required to compute the
                  distribution. Approximations that are easier to
                  calculate are required before more extensive
                  applications can be undertaken.},

  abstract =     {Sociologists have long advocated a sociological
                  approach to explanation by contrasting it with
                  common sense. The argument of this article, however,
                  is that sociologists rely on common sense more than
                  they realize. Moreover, this unacknowledged reliance
                  causes serious problems for their explanations of
                  social action, that is, for why people do what they
                  do. Many such explanations, it is argued, conflate
                  understandability with causality in ways that are
                  not valid by the standards of scientific
                  explanation. It follows that if sociologists want
                  their explanations to be scientifically valid, they
                  must evaluate them specifically on those grounds—in
                  particular, by forcing them to make predictions. In
                  becoming more scientific, however, it is predicted
                  that sociologists’ explanations will also become
                  less satisfying from an intuitive, sense-making
                  perspective. Even as novel sources of data and
                  improved methods open exciting new directions for
                  sociological research, therefore, sociologists will
                  increasingly have to choose between unsatisfying
                  scientific explanations and satisfying but
                  unscientific stories.},
